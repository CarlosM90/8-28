Belongs to: object is one of many that another object has. For example - a book belongs to an author who has written many books
Has many: flipside of belongs to. An object has many of another object. For example - a store has many CDs, an orange tree has many oranges. Think of it as an object has an array of other objects
We can link object classes together by their relationships through attributes, for example, a book instantiated with an author name can link to an author with that name. This is called “collaborating objects”
