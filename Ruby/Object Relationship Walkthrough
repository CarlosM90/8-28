Start by making two classes that will relate to each other

class Song

	attr_accessor :title, :artist
	
	def initialize(title)
		@title = title
	end

end 


class Artist

attr_accesor :name

def initialize(name)	
	@name = name
	end 

end

Now make some instances to test the relationship:

power = Song.new(“Power”)
power.title

kanye = Artist.new(“Kanye West”)

power.artist = kanye

power.artist

Now to demonstrate has many relationship:

Add a method to add songs, and a method to view all the songs

class Artist

attr_accessor :name

def initialize(name)	
	@name = name
	@songs = []
	end 

	def add_song(song)
		@songs << song
	end 
	
	def discography
		songs
	end


end

Add some songs
jesus_walks = Song.new(“Jesus Walks”)
stronger = Song.new(“Stronger”)
heartless = Song.new(“Heartless”)

kanye.add_song(jesus_walks)
kanye.add_song(stronger)
kanye.add_song(heartless)

kanye.discography
